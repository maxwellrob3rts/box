     <p><b>A Box is an Animal that Cannot Recognise It's Own Reflection.</b></p>
    <p>Male ruffed grouse are unique in a practice they engage in called drumming, where they assume position on a chosen log and strike their wings against the air to produce a sound like thunder. For the ruffed grouse, drumming is a courting ritual and it is always performed on the same chosen drumming log. It’s routine like this that the trappers can use to find a location to catch an animal in. To trap the male ruffed grouse its captor first creates a profile of the animal. The trapper imagines the ruffed grouse as aggressive and territorial during mating season. If another male tried to take his drumming spot, of course he would fight that grouse to protect it, after all, it’s only natural. Knowing this, the trapper places their trap in one of these drumming spots, and places a mirror inside it. The bird will see its reflection in this mirror but perceive it as an enemy male ruffed grouse and therefore go and attack it. In doing so he triggers the trap, catching him.
  The perception of another ruffed grouse in the mirrors reflection is not only the method of how the bird is caught, but serves as the captors justification. It’s inability to recognise its own reflection deems the ruffed grouse as a lesser species.
